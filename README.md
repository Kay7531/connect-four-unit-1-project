*Connect the Dance Troopers* is a connect-4 game with a fun stormtrooper theme. The user is first greeted by a start page that disappears after 2 seconds. Player 1 and Player 2 are tasked with getting their assigned stormtrooper themed pieces (red or yellow trooper helmets) to match them 4 in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to match 4 pieces in a row wins the round. The winner will be rewarded with a fun pop-up of dancing stormtroopers accompanied by retro synth-wave music.
